# Lambda Client

## About Lambda Client
Lambda client is a powerful software which reads the memory of the Roblox game process to provide the player with advantages such as seeing players through walls and automatically aiming at nearby players.

*This software has been developed purely for education purposes and without the intention of being used outside of an environment in which permission is given by the game owners for this software's use.*

## Features
- ESP: See players through walls
- Tracers: Draws a line from the middle of the screen to any players on screen.
- Aim-bot: Automatically aim at nearby players

## Final notes
This software is not complete. It has been tested on Rivals and Baseplate. Use `W, S & Enter` to travers the terminal menu.

It is likely that the offsets currenty used within the source code of this software are no longer accurate because I forgot about this project for about a two months and have only just come around to uploading it to github. In less technical terms, the code may not run propperly because the directions to the data it needs may be wrong with the newest version of Roblox.
